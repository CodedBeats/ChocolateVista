# 🍫 ChocolateVista

**ChocolateVista** is a chocolate review and discovery platform that I designed and built from the ground up as my final project for my *Advanced Web* class during uni.

This project showcases my first experience using **PHP**. I used **React.js** for the frontend and **SQL/phpMyAdmin** for the database layer. Although the subject was designed for teams of two, I chose to complete it solo, learning PHP and handling the full workload independently. The final result earned a **98/100** grade.

## 🎓 Project Background

This project followed a structured development process:

1. **Planning Phase** – Wireframes, feature lists, user flow design, and database schema
2. **Prototype** – A functional demo of the main features
3. **Final Build** – Fully implemented website with React, PHP backend, and MySQL database

The class encouraged team collaboration, but students who were confident in self-learning and managing the extra workload (or unconfident in other student's skills for my desired tech stack) could choose to work alone. This challenge helped me quickly develop practical skills in PHP, backend logic, and full-stack architecture.
